  "The type stats index is used to track the total number of resources and the
  number of changes to resources of a particular type.

  The total value is used in the search-type interaction as total value of the
  bundle if no search parameters were supplied.

  The number of changes value is used in the history-type interaction as total
  value of the bundle.

  The key used contains the tid (hash of the type) and the t of the transaction.
  The value contains two long values, the first for the total and the second for
  the number of changes.

  Each transaction which touches resources of a particular type, puts an entry
  with the new totals for this type at its t."
